# AudioFY Data

## Introduction

This repository contains the Java code and related configuration files for *AudioFY Data*, a
self-standing computer application for analyzing numerical datasets and
generating audio as well as visual representations of results.


## User Interface

## Data Input

### Data Source Selection

## Outputs

Specify which output type(s) to be generated at the bottom of the Main Window
prior to play-through. Text output files contain source data points as
well as the results of any normalization or transformations.

Output file types currently supported:


- Comma-Separated Value (.csv)
- Tab-Delimited (.txt)
- Audio File of the sonified data (.wav)

In the future, we hope to develop features to offer generating image (.png) and video (.mp4) files of the play-through and the final Graph Panel image after analysis conclusion.
