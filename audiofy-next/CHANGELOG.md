# Changelog

All notable changes to AudioFY are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed — Security & data integrity
- Replaced `xlsx@0.18.5` with `papaparse` + `exceljs` to close prototype-pollution (CVE-2023-30533) and ReDoS (GHSA-5pgg-2g8v-p4x9) advisories. ODS import is no longer supported — convert ODS files to XLSX or CSV.
- Missing/non-numeric cells now propagate as `NaN` end-to-end instead of being silently filled with `0`. Rows with `NaN` in the mapped X/Y columns are skipped by the audio engine, omitted from the scatter plot, and rendered as an em-dash (`—`) in the data table. Stats ignore `NaN` inputs, and normalization preserves `NaN` outputs.
- `ParsedSheet` now carries `columnQuality: ColumnQuality[]` through the worker boundary so the import preview can surface per-column data-quality metrics.

### Added — UX
- **Sparse-column warning badge** — the import preview modal now flags any numeric column whose populated ratio is below 90% (at least 10% blank), showing the blank percentage and an explanation that missing data will be skipped during playback and not plotted.

### Added — Phase 3: Performance
- **Virtualized data table** — renders only visible rows with a 10-row overscan buffer, enabling smooth scrolling for large datasets. Added `aria-rowindex` and `aria-rowcount` for accessibility.
- **Optimized scatter plot rendering** — decoupled SVG structure setup from data point updates. Changing data sources no longer triggers a full SVG rebuild.
- **Web Worker file parsing** — `parseFile()` runs in a background thread via `parser.worker.ts` to keep the UI responsive during import. Falls back to synchronous parsing when Workers are unavailable.

### Added — Phase 2: Core UX
- **Sheet selection modal** — when importing multi-sheet files (xlsx, ods), a modal lets users preview each sheet's first 5 rows and select which one to import. Numeric columns are marked with `#`, and a warning appears if fewer than 2 numeric columns are found.
- **X/Y column selectors** — dropdowns in the settings panel to remap which columns are used for the X and Y axes without re-importing.
- **Save/Load settings** — Save button (or `Ctrl+S`) exports playback, visualization, and audio configuration to an `audiofy-settings.json` file. Load button restores settings from a previously saved file with full Zod schema validation. Data sources are re-imported from the original spreadsheet files.
- **Expanded test coverage** — added tests for audio export, store operations (pending import, column mapping, config restoration), bringing the suite to 277 tests.

### Added — Phase 1: Quick Wins
- **Chart/table interaction** — clicking a scatter plot point or data table row now seeks playback to that data point's position.
- **Chorus effect** — fully wired Tone.Chorus node in the audio engine with UI controls (rate, depth, delay) in the settings panel.

### Changed — Phase 1
- **Export naming** — corrected UI labels from "WAV" to "Audio (WebM/Opus)" to match the actual export format.

### Removed — Phase 1
- Unused `ProgressCallback` type and `onProgress` method from AudioEngine.
- Unused `onPlay`/`onPause` props from PlaybackControls and Toolbar.
- Deprecated `exportWAV` alias (use `exportAudio`).

### Fixed — Third Audit Pass (55 total fixes across 3 passes)
- Store `parsedFiles` converted from `Map` to `Record` for JSON serialization.
- `removeSource` now auto-selects the next source and cleans orphaned parsed files.
- `useSyncController` stale closure over `playbackConfig` fixed with ref pattern.
- `computeNotes` validates `audioMapping` before accessing properties.
- `exportAudio` differentiates between user cancellation and recording errors.
- `useFileImport` exhaustive-deps lint fix.
- `SourceList` live region for screen reader announcements on selection changes.
- Error banner focus management for accessibility.
- Drop zone `aria-dropeffect` and `aria-label` attributes.
- `useKeyboardShortcuts` ref pattern to register listener only once.
